This Chat App is a simple full-stack application that allows users to send and receive messages instantly, share files, and connect to a third-party service for video calls.

This project was built to understand the fundamentals of real-time communication, client–server interaction, and full-stack integration. While it is a basic version and not production-grade, it demonstrates key concepts of building modern chat applications.

**Tech Stack**
_Frontend_: React.js (UI for chat, file sharing, and integration with video calls)

_Backend_: Java Spring Boot (REST APIs, WebSocket support for real-time messaging)

_Database_: (Your DB here – e.g., MySQL / MongoDB) for storing users and messages

_Other Tools_: WebSocket / STOMP for real-time communication

**Features**
_Real-Time Messaging_:Instant message delivery between connected users.

_File Sharing_: Upload and share files within the chat.

_Video Chat_ (via Third-Party App): Integrated with an external service (e.g., Zoom/Google Meet/Jitsi) for video calling.

_Basic User Interface_: Simple and easy-to-use React-based UI.

_Basic Authentication_: (Optional, if you added login) Support for registering and logging in users.

**Project Purpose**

The app is not advanced but serves as a learning project to practice:

Building a full-stack application with React (frontend) and Spring Boot (backend).

Implementing real-time communication with WebSockets.

Understanding how to integrate third-party services like video chat.

This foundation can be extended in the future with features like group chats, message encryption, notifications, and advanced authentication.
